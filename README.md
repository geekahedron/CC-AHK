autohotkey script for Crush Crush automation

For game running as a standalone application (from Steam), script will automatically find the game window and click through the screens to purchase gifts and dates.
To specify a gift, use the full name of the gift from the game in lowercase with no spaces ("chocolates" or "fruitbasket" or "cutepuppy")
The script assumes a reset/speed boost that doesn't require waiting (you can also change the "WaitToDate" variable when running the script).
The script assumes you are starting from the girl's page with no windows open.
